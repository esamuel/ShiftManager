# ShiftManager.app Website Status

## Current Status: ❌ **NO WEBSITE EXISTS**

### What I Found:

1. **Domain Status**: `shiftmanager.app` is **NOT registered** or **NOT configured**
   - DNS lookup failed - no such host exists
   - The domain is either not purchased or not set up yet

2. **Documentation Exists**: You have a comprehensive guide ready
   - File: `WEBSITE_LEGAL_DOCUMENTS.md`
   - Contains complete HTML for Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
   - Includes deployment instructions for GitHub Pages, Google Sites, etc.

3. **Email References**: The documentation mentions:
   - `support@shiftmanager.app`
   - `privacy@shiftmanager.app`
   - These won't work until the domain is set up

## What You Need to Do:

### Option 1: Register the Domain (Recommended for Professional Look)
1. **Purchase `shiftmanager.app`** from a domain registrar:
   - Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.
   - Cost: ~$10-20/year

2. **Host the legal pages**:
   - Use the HTML files in `WEBSITE_LEGAL_DOCUMENTS.md`
   - Deploy to: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or simple hosting

3. **Set up email forwarding**:
   - Configure `support@shiftmanager.app` to forward to your personal email

### Option 2: Use GitHub Pages (FREE - Fastest Solution)
1. **Create a GitHub repository**: `shiftmanager-legal`
2. **Upload the HTML files**:
   - `privacy.html`
   - `terms.html`
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
4. **URLs will be**:
   - `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/shiftmanager-legal/privacy.html`
   - `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/shiftmanager-legal/terms.html`

### Option 3: Use Google Sites (FREE - No Coding)
1. Go to sites.google.com
2. Create a new site
3. Add two pages with the privacy and terms content
4. Publish and get public URLs

## For App Store Submission:

Apple **REQUIRES** publicly accessible URLs for:
- ✅ Privacy Policy (REQUIRED for ALL apps)
- ✅ Terms of Service (REQUIRED for apps with IAP/subscriptions)

**You MUST set up at least one of the options above before submitting to the App Store.**

## Quick Action Plan:

### Immediate (Before App Store Submission):
1. Choose Option 2 (GitHub Pages) for fastest deployment
2. Create the repository and upload HTML files
3. Get the public URLs
4. Add URLs to App Store Connect

### Long-term (Professional):
1. Purchase `shiftmanager.app` domain
2. Set up proper hosting
3. Configure email forwarding
4. Update App Store Connect with new URLs

## Recommendation:

**Start with GitHub Pages TODAY** (takes 10 minutes):
- It's free
- It's reliable
- It meets Apple's requirements
- You can migrate to a custom domain later

Then, when you have time:
- Purchase the `shiftmanager.app` domain
- Set up professional hosting
- Update the URLs in App Store Connect
